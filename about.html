                <h3>How are we shifitng the narrative?</h3>
                <p>The first phase, Cinnarios ‚Äò001, will focus on showcasing art in advanced and meaningful ways (beyond entertainment or exclusivity) through powerful storytelling, articles, and documentary series. By highlighting real-life experiences of diverse artists, especially within the African community, we aim to dispel the myth that art is only for a select few. This model will lay the foundation for a larger project addressing the limited access to art education and upskilling resources in Africa.</p>
